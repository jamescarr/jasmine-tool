# Jasmine Commandline Tool
I've been working with jasmine a bit for client side BDD. I like it but didn't like the gem too much so I decided to give a try at rolling my own tool written for node.js. 

## Installation instructions
This module is available for installation via npm. To install it simply type

	npm install jasmine-runner

## Usage

### jasmine init
Will create a new project structure in the current working directory with a few sample specs and source object

### jasmine run
Starts up the jasmine server to run specs from. Navigate to the url specified on the command line after running this command to manually run specs.

### jasmine mon
Starts the jasmine spec server up and monitors for file changes. Navigate to the url specified on the commandline to "capture" a browser. Now any file changes to specs or javascript files in the src_dir will make the browser automatically reload and rerun specs.

### jasmine ci
Fires up the server, spawns a browser pointed to the test server, captures the results and shuts down. Ideal for CI systems.

(This feature may be fuzzy until it gets reworked... the current implementation is inflexible)

## Configuration
Use jasmine.json in the root of your project dir to configure the runner. Here are a break down of the fields that the runner pays attention to:

### src_dir
Specifies where to load source files from

### spec_dir
Specifies where to load specs from

### mon  
####build_cmd
In monitor mode : specify here a command to execute when files change but before browser reloads and specs rerun. For example a build command.

### externals
An array of miscelanious scripts to include, like jquery

### server
configuration details for the server, such as port

## Missing a Feature?
